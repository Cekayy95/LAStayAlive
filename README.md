## Why i created this afk bot.
Personally i dont like AFK-Bots => but there is no way i will wait for average 20k+ ppl to get through the queue.
This Project was created quick and dirty no intentions for any exception catching etc..
if it break it breaks => just a quick and dirty way to be logged in when you come home from work.

i would love that you only use this script if your server-queue's are higher than 10k+ ppl during peak.
# Installation
